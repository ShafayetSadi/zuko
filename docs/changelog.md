### Added

- **Core Execution Engine (Python only)**

  - Runs Python code inside Docker containers.
  - Enforces CPU, memory, and process limits.
  - Sandboxes execution (no network, read-only FS, no new privileges).

  - Integrated `/usr/bin/time` for Codeforces-like reporting.
  - Reports CPU time (user + system) in ms.
  - Reports peak memory (RSS) in KB.

- **Custom Python Runtime Image**

  - Built `zuko-python:3.12` with `time` pre-installed.
  - Runs as non-root user for security.

- **Testing Infrastructure**

  - Added stress tests (CPU-heavy, memory-heavy, I/O, error, timeout).
  - Verified results match Codeforces-style reporting.

- **Documentation Setup**
  - Created `docs/progress/` for weekly devlogs.
  - Added `CHANGELOG.md` for milestone tracking.
  - Adopted Conventional Commits for clean history.
